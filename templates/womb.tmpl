		<td colspan="2" class="snippit" border="5px"> This initiative sets forth  design, development, and evaluation of cloud based microservice/cluster
			infrastructure for formal technologies.  Most academic endeavors in this field either do not use clusters
		or use them in a very rudimentary way.  Commercial engines are starting to be based on cloud infrastructure
		where communication, dispatch, decomposition, and dispatch of formal methods are advanced.  This initiative
		involves co-engagement from academia and industry to propose define and deploy (in public where possible)  microservice/protocol 
		based communication between formal processing components </td>

		<td colspan="2" class="snippit"> This initiative targets alternative intellectual property instruments, aimed at further enabling technologists
			and small organisations.
		Existing IP instruments are not crowd sourced and often form barriers to innovation by imposing 
		undue legal overhead or risks in producing works, even sometimes trivial ones. Additionally, existing instruments
		assume a race to establish lack of prior art or even plagiarism in a world of ideas and writings which has become too complex and fast paced for any 
		entity to truly establish such characteristics.  This initiative targets these problems by proposing
